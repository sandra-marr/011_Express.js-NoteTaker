## Description 
This application takes inputs from the user in the browser, and stores them as notes. The user can recall prior notes, create new notes, or delete existing notes as needed. This can be usefull to keep track of tasks, or other information needed throughout the day since it is mobile friendly. The reason for building was to create a simple and clean way to manage notes.


## Lessons Learned
This application utilized express and inquirer. While I have used inquirer previously, developing this application required more advanced use of the tool, which helped my knowledge base grow. I also learned a lot about setting up a server and connecting it to the front-end.
